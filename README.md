# ShapeAC: A ShapeZ-Inspired Course Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code for an Advanced Programming course project inspired by [Shapez](https://shapez.io/), a game focused on automation and shape processing. The project aims to implement core gameplay mechanics.

## Development Status ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
This project is a half-complete course project, and I'll be tackling the bugs when I get more time. 
But if you spot anything odd and feel like helping out, your contributions are more than welcome!

## Features
- **Shape Creation**: Generate, combine, and process different shapes.
- **Conveyor System**: Transport shapes between different processing units.
- **Expandable Design**: Modular structure for adding new mechanics.

## Usage
- Follow the on-screen instructions to create and transport shapes.
- Experiment with automation to optimize workflows.
- Modify and extend components to enhance gameplay mechanics.
